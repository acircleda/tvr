            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>Have you ever wanted to watch your favorite show but cannot decide which episode to watch? I built <strong>pickmy.show</strong> to solve this very problem! This is a personal project of a computer nerd and TV junkie who couldn't decide which Futurama episode to watching - having seen each one a hundred times.</p>
            <p>By the way, any ad revenue or donations go directly toward maintence and hosting costs.</p>
            <p>If you have made it this far, thanks for stopping by! I hope you have enjoyed the app.</p>
